# Contributing

## Version Control

The `main` branch is protected; to contribute, you must make pull requests and squash merge.

We track plans over time in a tab on the [CMUCourses doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H4uo0cL9VYcOD_I-Tu5CQJo2MYwYImrApvmu-9PsjRs/edit?tab=t.h4ukwmdtbp6i).

## Tooling

Use git and Rust (big surprise!).

You can install [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to use the [justfile](./justfile) (e.g. `just doc`). Or, just copy over the commands.

just is nice for storing a source of knowledge about useful terminal commands with respect to any project.

We might discuss formatting and such later (rustfmt, markdown fmt, docstring standards, precommit).
