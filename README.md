# CMUCourses Data Layer

An experimental, WIP Rust library for more performant processing, search, and rendering of CMUCourses data. (Since this is just a Rust library for now, integrating it into a CMUCourses application is on the user.)

Here's a general idea of what we're trying to work toward:

- WASM clientside search

To get an idea of the interface, feel free to browse the docs (`cargo doc --no-deps --open`). Also, browse commands you can run with `just` or by opening the [justfile](./justfile).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for developer standards.
